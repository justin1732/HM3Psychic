# Psychic Game
## Feeling Lucky?

This was the third individual project for the University of Denver FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This very basic app uses Javascript to try and get the user to guess what letter the system has keyed up in its storage. The user enters a key and the display indicates whether or not that guess was correct. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the display informs the user that they lost. Guess correctly, and the display lets the user know they won.

## Using the App on Github
This app is deployed at https://justin1732.github.io/HM3Psychic/

## Starting the app locally

For a local version, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. Navigate over to my GitHub repo, located at https://github.com/justin1732/HM3Psychic, click clone, and be sure to type in the following below:
git clone
Then navigate to the HTML file and load it.

## Using this application

Users simply need to hit a key and the display will tell them if they are correct or not.

## Technologies Used

This application uses primarily HTML with embedded CSS. The working part of the app uses Javascript, specifically Ajax, to read and understand the user input.
